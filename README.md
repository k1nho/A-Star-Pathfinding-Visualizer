# A* Pathfinding Visualizer

## Project

The project consists of a visual implementation of the A* pathfinding algorithm for finding the shortest path between two nodes in a graph.

``` A* algorithm
f(n) = g(n) + h(n)
n:    represents the next node on the graph,
g(n): represents the cost of the path from the start node, 
h(n): is a heuristic that estimates cost from n to the endpoint. 
```
